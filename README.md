## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a fruit detection model using the YOLO V8 architecture. The notebook demonstrates the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Model Training
3. Model Evaluation
4. Visualization of Results

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images of various fruits. Each image is annotated with bounding boxes indicating the locations of the fruits.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you need to have Python and Jupyter installed. Additionally, you need to install the required libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/fruit-detection-yolo-v8.git
    cd fruit-detection-yolo-v8
    ```

2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Fruit\ Detection\ Using\ YOLO\ V8.ipynb
    ```

3. Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

## Results

The final model is evaluated on the test set, and the notebook includes visualization of detected fruits in sample images.
